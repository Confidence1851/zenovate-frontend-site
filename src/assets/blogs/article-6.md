Peptide therapy has evolved into a global trend in wellness, longevity, and performance medicine. Among the most talked about combinations internationally is the pairing of Ipamorelin + CJC-1295.

While these peptides remain research only in Canada and the USA, wellness clinics across Europe, South America, Asia, and the Middle East frequently incorporate these peptides in programs focused on anti-aging, recovery, metabolic health, and body composition.

# What Are Ipamorelin and CJC-1295?

## What Are Ipamorelin and CJC-1295?

### Ipamorelin

Ipamorelin is a Growth Hormone–Releasing Peptide (GHRP) that stimulates the pituitary gland to increase natural GH (growth hormone) secretion. It is often called the *“cleanest GHRP”* because it does NOT significantly increase cortisol or prolactin.

Users internationally commonly report:

* Improved sleep quality

* Better post-exercise recovery

* Increased fat metabolism

* Enhanced muscle tone

* Boosted daytime energy

### CJC-1295

CJC-1295 is a Growth Hormone–Releasing Hormone (GHRH) analog. It increases GH and IGF-1 levels with a long duration of action due to its DAC technology, which extends its half-life significantly.

In simple terms:  
CJC-1295 sets a stable GH baseline, while Ipamorelin delivers strong GH pulses.  
This synergy is why they are so commonly stacked in wellness protocols.

# Why This Combo Is Used in Global Wellness Clinics

Internationally, they are used for:

* Body recomposition (fat loss + muscle gain)

* Anti-aging and cosmetic wellness

* Sleep optimization

* Recovery enhancement

* Metabolic support

* Performance and fitness programs

Longevity clinics often market this combination as a way to “support natural GH rhythm” without administering synthetic growth hormone.

# How Ipamorelin Works

### 1. Selective GH release

Ipamorelin stimulates the ghrelin receptor, triggering GH release from the pituitary.

Unlike many GHRPs:

* It does not significantly increase cortisol

* It does not spike prolactin

* It minimizes hunger spikes

This makes it suitable for wellness settings internationally.

### 2. Support for fat metabolism

Growth hormone naturally promotes lipolysis, so increasing GH pulses can support fat-burning pathways.

### 3. Enhanced sleep cycles

Studies show growth hormone surges during deep sleep. Ipamorelin may enhance sleep quality, contributing to recovery.

How CJC-1295 Works

### 1. Prolonged GH secretion

CJC-1295 binds to albumin, extending its half-life from minutes to days.  
 This allows for a more stable and sustained rise in GH and IGF-1.

### 2. Synergistic effect with GHRPs

When combined with Ipamorelin:

* GH pulses are stronger

* The baseline GH level is higher

* IGF-1 production increases

### 3. Cellular repair and metabolism

Higher IGF-1 correlates with:

* improved lean muscle

* better bone density

* enhanced metabolic rate

* stronger repair mechanisms

# Promising Outcomes From Research

Although human research is limited, studies suggest:

### 1. Increased IGF-1 levels

Clinical trials with CJC-1295 showed dose-dependent increases in IGF-1 lasting up to 14 days.

### 2. Improved body composition

Early studies on GHRH + GHRP combinations suggest potential for:

* reduced fat mass

* increased lean mass

* improved nitrogen retention

### 3. Enhanced sleep quality

GH secretagogues often improve slow-wave sleep — crucial for hormone balance and recovery.

### 4. Support in aging physiology

Age-related GH decline may influence energy, metabolism, and muscle mass. These peptides are explored internationally for age-related wellness protocols.

# Potential Side Effects (Reported Internationally)

Most are mild and reversible:

* Temporary fatigue  
* Headache

* Light flushing

* Water retention (rare)

* Tingling in hands or feet

* Increased hunger (more common with other GHRPs than Ipamorelin)

These peptides should not be used by individuals with active cancers.

# Who Should Avoid GH Secretagogues?

Based on international guidelines, they should be avoided in:

* Anyone with active or recent cancer

* Pregnant or breastfeeding women

* Individuals with uncontrolled diabetes

* Severe cardiovascular disease

* Individuals on immunosuppressive therapy

* People with known pituitary disorders

## Anticipated Human Dosing

If approved someday, common human dosing could resemble:  
60–75 mcg per day, 5 days/week

(Reflecting international wellness patterns.)

## Not Recommended For

* Active cancer

* Pregnant/breastfeeding individuals

* Uncontrolled diabetes

* Pituitary disorders

* Severe heart disease

* Individuals with MEN2 syndromes
