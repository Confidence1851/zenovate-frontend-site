### No Clinical Diagnosis or Treatment

Zenovate is not responsible for the interpretation of information provided and does not offer clinical diagnosis, treatment recommendations, or second opinions. All medical treatments, prescriptions, and interventions should be discussed directly with a healthcare professional. Any telehealth services provided through Zenovate are delivered by licensed healthcare professionals who are not employees of Zenovate, and all medical decisions made are solely under their discretion and responsibility.

### Limitations of Information

Health-related information can change rapidly with advancements in medical research. While Zenovate aims to ensure that the information presented is as accurate and reliable as possible, we cannot guarantee that all content is complete, correct, or up-to-date. This website may cover topics such as treatments, supplements, and health management practices that may not be applicable or safe for every individual. Patients should always discuss any new treatments or changes in their healthcare regimen with a licensed healthcare provider.

### Not an Emergency Service

The information provided on this website and through telehealth services does not replace emergency medical care. If you believe you are experiencing a medical emergency, call your local emergency number immediately. Zenovate is not designed to handle acute, severe, or life-threatening conditions and should not be used as a replacement for urgent medical care.

### Product Information Disclaimer

Any information provided about products, including vitamins, wellness supplements, or self-injection therapies, is meant for general educational purposes and is not intended to replace consultation with a qualified healthcare provider. Statements regarding the efficacy or safety of specific products have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Health Canada (HC) unless explicitly stated. These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Individual results from using products may vary, and the appropriateness of any product or service for your specific condition should be determined by a healthcare professional.

## Doctor-Patient Relationship

Use of Zenovate’s website and services does not establish a formal doctor-patient relationship. While Zenovate provides access to telehealth services through licensed healthcare professionals, the platform itself serves solely as a facilitator connecting patients with these independent providers. Any interaction through Zenovate, including consultations, prescriptions, or product recommendations, is governed by the independent professional judgement of the licensed healthcare providers, not Zenovate.

### Role of Zenovate as a Facilitator

Zenovate is not a healthcare provider and does not practise medicine. The role of Zenovate is limited to facilitating telehealth services by offering a platform for users to connect with licensed medical professionals. Zenovate does not employ or supervise healthcare providers and does not control their professional medical judgement or decisions. These healthcare providers are solely responsible for all medical care, including the advice, treatment, or prescriptions they provide during telehealth consultations.

### Independent Medical Judgment

All telehealth consultations offered via Zenovate are conducted by licensed healthcare professionals, who are solely responsible for the care provided. Any advice or information received during a telehealth consultation should be treated as medical advice from that healthcare provider. Zenovate does not interfere with or influence the independent medical decisions made by the healthcare providers connected through the platform.

### No Assumption of Medical Liability

Zenovate does not assume any liability for the medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or prescriptions provided by healthcare professionals through telehealth services. The relationship you establish with a healthcare provider during a consultation is governed by the applicable medical and legal frameworks between you and the provider. Zenovate’s role is purely administrative, and we are not responsible for any adverse outcomes that may arise from medical care provided through the platform.

### No Guarantee of Care or Treatment

Using Zenovate’s platform does not guarantee that a prescription will be issued or that any specific medical treatment will be provided. Telehealth consultations facilitated through Zenovate are evaluated case by case by the healthcare provider, and the decision to prescribe or recommend treatment rests solely with them. Healthcare providers are bound by their own professional standards and legal obligations, and Zenovate has no control over their medical decisions.

### No Emergency Services

Zenovate does not provide emergency medical services or real-time medical care for urgent or life-threatening conditions. The platform is not intended to be used for acute or emergency healthcare situations. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, you should immediately call your local emergency number or seek in-person medical assistance.

### Scope of Services

The healthcare providers available through Zenovate may be licensed in different jurisdictions, and their services may be subject to the specific laws and regulations governing the practice of medicine in your location. Zenovate ensures that the healthcare providers who interact with patients are appropriately licensed in the relevant jurisdictions, but any medical relationship formed is exclusively between the patient and provider, subject to the provider's licensure laws.

### Third-Party Medical Services

In certain cases, Zenovate may facilitate the delivery of healthcare products or services via third-party providers such as pharmacies or diagnostic services. These third parties are independent entities and not employees or agents of Zenovate. Zenovate disclaims responsibility for any actions, omissions, or errors on the part of these third-party providers.

## Telehealth Consent

By accessing and using Zenovate’s telehealth services, you are agreeing to participate in a healthcare consultation delivered via telecommunications technology. You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms outlined in this consent form. Telehealth involves the use of electronic communications to enable healthcare providers to assess, diagnose, consult, treat, and provide follow-up care remotely.

### Informed Consent for Telehealth Services

By proceeding with a telehealth consultation, you understand that:
Nature of Telehealth: Telehealth allows healthcare providers to deliver care without being physically present. This may include live video consultations, phone calls, digital image sharing, and the transmission of medical records or other personal health data.

Risks and Limitations: Telehealth consultations have inherent risks. These include the potential for incomplete transmission of information, disruptions in service due to technical difficulties, and limitations in the ability to conduct a full physical examination. Additionally, telehealth may not be appropriate for all medical conditions. You are aware of these risks and agree that the healthcare provider will use their professional judgement to determine whether the telehealth service is suitable for your needs​.

### Privacy and Security

Zenovate ensures that telehealth services are conducted in accordance with HIPAA and other applicable privacy regulations. Your personal health information (PHI) is protected by encryption, secure transmission methods, and restricted access to authorized personnel. However, you acknowledge that there are inherent privacy risks with the use of electronic communication, such as potential unauthorized access to your data during transmission​

### Technology Requirements

To use telehealth services, you must have access to a device with internet capabilities, such as a smartphone, computer, or tablet. It is your responsibility to ensure the availability and functionality of the necessary technology, and Zenovate is not liable for any technical issues that may disrupt the consultation​

### Medical Records and Documentation

Your telehealth consultation, including any diagnosis or treatment provided, will be documented in accordance with healthcare regulations. You have the right to access your medical records, and all information shared during telehealth consultations will be stored securely and kept confidential.

### Consent to Treatment

By agreeing to participate in telehealth, you consent to the healthcare provider making recommendations, diagnosing conditions, and potentially prescribing medications or treatments based on the information provided during the consultation. You also understand that healthcare providers may decide telehealth is not appropriate for your condition, in which case they may advise you to seek in-person care.

### Voluntary Participation

You have the right to withhold or withdraw your consent to telehealth at any time. If you choose to discontinue telehealth services, this decision will not affect your right to future treatment, although it may necessitate seeking care in-person.

### Financial Responsibility

By consenting to telehealth services, you agree to take responsibility for all associated costs. Zenovate will provide information regarding the costs of telehealth services in advance, and you will be responsible for any fees or copayments associated with the consultation.

### Emergency Situations

Telehealth services offered through Zenovate are not intended for emergency care. In case of a medical emergency, please call your local emergency number or visit the nearest emergency medical facility immediately. Zenovate is not responsible for any delay in receiving care in emergency situations.

### Acknowledgment of Understanding

By using Zenovate’s telehealth services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Telehealth Consent form. You agree to the terms outlined and understand the potential risks, benefits, and limitations of telehealth. You also understand that telehealth may not be an appropriate substitute for in-person care in every situation, and you accept responsibility for any actions you take based on the consultation.

## Product Statements

The statements made about products available on Zenovate’s platform, including vitamins, supplements, and wellness injections, have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada (HC), unless explicitly stated otherwise. Our products are intended to support general health and wellness, but they are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition.

### Intended Use of Products

Zenovate offers products that are designed to promote overall wellness, including self-injectable vitamins and supplements. These products should only be used as directed, and you should consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, taking medication, or have a pre-existing medical condition.

### No FDA or Health Canada Evaluation

Unless specifically stated, the claims made regarding the benefits of the products sold through Zenovate have not been reviewed or approved by the FDA or Health Canada. This applies to both dietary supplements and injectable vitamins that may be available through our platform. These products are marketed as part of a wellness strategy, and their effects may not be supported by clinical trials. Users should be aware of this distinction when making purchasing decisions​

### Consultation with a Healthcare Provider

Before using any product provided through Zenovate, we strongly recommend consulting with a licensed healthcare provider to ensure it is appropriate for your specific needs. Any information or suggestions provided on this website or by our support team should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice. The effectiveness of products may vary from person to person, and certain products may not be suitable for everyone.

### Results May Vary

The experiences of other users of Zenovate’s products may not reflect your individual results. Many factors, including genetics, lifestyle, pre-existing conditions, and adherence to the recommended usage guidelines, can influence how effective a product is for you. The results mentioned in customer reviews, testimonials, or product descriptions are based on individual experiences and do not guarantee similar outcomes for all users.

### No Medical Claims

Zenovate does not make medical claims about the efficacy of any of the products offered on our platform unless explicitly backed by scientific evidence and clearly stated. While some of the products may have been used in clinical contexts, they are provided on this platform for general wellness and should not be used as a replacement for professional medical treatment for any diagnosed medical conditions.

### Supplement and Injectable Safety

The supplements and injectable wellness products offered by Zenovate are intended for use in accordance with the instructions provided. Self-administration of injectable products carries inherent risks, including but not limited to infection, incorrect dosage, or allergic reactions. Users should follow all product guidelines closely and consult healthcare providers if they experience any adverse reactions or concerns during use.

### Individual Responsibility for Use

By purchasing and using any products offered through Zenovate, you acknowledge that you are doing so at your own discretion and assume all responsibility for any outcomes resulting from their use. Zenovate is not liable for any side effects, complications, or unintended consequences resulting from the use of our products, particularly if they are used contrary to the instructions provided or without professional medical supervision​.

### No Cure or Prevention Claims

Unless explicitly stated, our products are not marketed as treatments for any medical conditions. Zenovate does not claim that any of our products can cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent any disease. If you have any concerns about specific health conditions or diseases, we recommend seeking advice from your doctor or other qualified healthcare professionals.

### Supplement Regulations

While dietary supplements and wellness products are regulated to ensure safety and quality, they are not subject to the same rigorous standards of testing and approval as prescription medications. Supplements are regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which allows manufacturers to market products without pre-approval from the FDA, as long as they do not make drug-like claims​.

## Medical Care Disclaimer

Zenovate provides access to telehealth services, including consultations with licensed healthcare providers, as well as products intended to support general wellness. However, the services and products offered through this platform are not a substitute for in-person medical care and should not be relied upon for managing acute or serious medical conditions.

### Telehealth Limitations

Telehealth services, while convenient and beneficial in many cases, have inherent limitations compared to in-person care. Healthcare providers offering telemedicine consultations through Zenovate rely on the information provided by the patient, including medical history, symptoms, and descriptions. Due to the nature of remote consultations, providers may not have access to the full diagnostic tools or ability to perform physical examinations as they would during an in-person visit. Therefore, telemedicine may not be the appropriate form of care for all medical conditions, particularly those requiring immediate intervention or diagnostic procedures​

### Not a Replacement for Primary Care

Zenovate’s telehealth services are intended to supplement, not replace, your relationship with a primary healthcare provider. Regular check-ups, in-person examinations, and diagnostic testing are crucial for maintaining overall health. Patients are encouraged to consult their primary care physicians regularly and to use telehealth services as a complement to, not a replacement for, their ongoing healthcare.

### Suitability for Telehealth

Not all medical issues can be adequately addressed via telehealth consultations. Certain symptoms or conditions may require in-person visits for more thorough evaluation, testing, or treatment. Healthcare providers on Zenovate’s platform will use their professional judgement to determine whether a telehealth consultation is sufficient or if you should seek in-person care. If a provider believes that telehealth is not appropriate for your condition, they may recommend that you visit a clinic or hospital for further evaluation​

### Non-Emergency Medical Services

Zenovate does not provide emergency medical services. If you are experiencing a medical emergency or require urgent care, you should contact your local emergency services immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. The telehealth services offered through Zenovate are intended for non-emergency medical issues that can reasonably be addressed through remote consultations​.

### No Guarantees of Treatment

While Zenovate provides access to licensed healthcare providers, there is no guarantee that you will receive a diagnosis, treatment, or prescription during a telehealth consultation. Healthcare providers will make decisions based on the information available and their professional judgement. Some conditions may require additional testing, imaging, or in-person visits before a diagnosis or treatment plan can be determined.

### Personal Responsibility for Health Management

Patients using Zenovate are responsible for providing accurate and complete information about their health conditions, symptoms, and medical history during telehealth consultations. Misrepresentation or withholding of information can affect the quality and safety of the care provided. It is the patient's responsibility to follow the advice of healthcare providers, including recommendations for in-person care, and to seek emergency assistance when necessary.

### No Endorsement of Providers

While Zenovate connects users with licensed healthcare professionals, the company does not endorse or guarantee the services provided by these professionals. All healthcare providers operate independently of Zenovate and are responsible for the medical care they deliver. Zenovate does not control or interfere with the healthcare providers' clinical decisions, and the platform is not responsible for any medical advice, treatment, or services provided.

## Compliance and Privacy

Zenovate is committed to protecting your personal health information (PHI) and ensuring compliance with applicable privacy laws in both the United States and Canada. This includes adherence to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the U.S., Ontario’s Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA), and Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). This section explains how your health data is collected, used, shared, and protected when using Zenovate’s telehealth platform and services.

### Compliance with HIPAA Regulations

Zenovate complies with all requirements under HIPAA, which mandates that healthcare providers and related entities protect the privacy and security of patient information. The healthcare providers, pharmacies, and any business associates working through the Zenovate platform are required to comply with HIPAA standards, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your protected health information​.

Compliance with PHIPA (Ontario, Canada)

In Ontario, Zenovate adheres to the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA), which governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal health information by healthcare providers. PHIPA provides similar protections to HIPAA but is specific to Ontario’s healthcare system.

Data Collection and Use: Under PHIPA, Zenovate ensures that personal health information is collected with your consent and used only for the purposes for which it was collected, such as providing telehealth services or sharing information with healthcare professionals involved in your care​
Patient Consent: Zenovate will only collect, use, or disclose your health information with your consent or as required by law. PHIPA grants patients the right to control their personal health data and request access to their health records.

Safeguards: Zenovate applies strict security measures to protect your health data, ensuring compliance with PHIPA’s standards for electronic health records and secure communication.

### Compliance with PIPEDA (Canada)

In other provinces across Canada, Zenovate complies with PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act). PIPEDA regulates how personal information is handled in the course of commercial activities. Although PIPEDA applies to non-health sectors, it governs how Zenovate protects your personal information, including your health data, in provinces where no health-specific privacy laws exist.

- Collection and Disclosure: Under PIPEDA, Zenovate ensures that personal information, including health-related data, is only collected for specific, lawful purposes and is disclosed only with your consent or as required by law​
- Right to Access: Similar to HIPAA and PHIPA, PIPEDA gives you the right to access your personal information, correct inaccuracies, and request details on how your information is being used.

### Collection of Personal Health Information

When you use Zenovate’s platform, we may collect certain personal and medical information, including your name, contact details, medical history, and any information you share during telehealth consultations. This information is necessary to provide you with accurate medical advice, treatment, or prescriptions and to ensure that healthcare providers can make informed decisions about your care.

Use and Disclosure of Your Information

Zenovate only uses your health information for purposes related to providing telehealth services, which may include:

- Facilitating telehealth consultations between you and licensed healthcare providers.
- Processing and fulfilling any prescriptions ordered by healthcare providers through the platform.

Your personal health information will only be shared with individuals or entities involved in your care, and we will not disclose your information for other purposes without your explicit consent, except as required or permitted by law. Zenovate may disclose your information to comply with legal obligations, such as court orders or public health reporting requirements​

- Prescriptions and Medications: You agree to use prescription medications obtained through Zenovate only as directed by your healthcare provider. Any misuse of prescription medications, including selling or sharing them with others, is prohibited and may result in legal consequences.

### Responsible Use of Telehealth Services

- Appropriate Use: Only use telehealth services for legitimate medical concerns and consultations. You agree not to abuse or misuse telehealth services for non-medical purposes or to obtain medications for illegitimate or illegal reasons​.

### Use of Platform for Personal Purposes

Zenovate’s platform is intended for personal, non-commercial use.

Any unauthorized commercial use of the platform is strictly prohibited and may result in the suspension or termination of your account​

### Prohibition of Fraudulent Activity

This includes, but is not limited to, providing false information, creating fake accounts, or using the platform to obtain prescriptions or medications under false pretenses. Zenovate reserves the right to investigate and take legal action against any fraudulent activity​

### Age Restrictions

By using Zenovate’s platform, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age. Zenovate’s services are intended for adult users only, and we do not knowingly collect information from individuals under the age of 18. If we discover that a user under 18 has created an account or provided personal information, we will take appropriate steps to delete the account and information​

### Termination of Use

Zenovate reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate any of the terms outlined in this disclaimer or engage in any unlawful activity. We also reserve the right to take legal action against individuals who abuse the platform, its services, or violate any applicable laws.

## Licensing and State Laws

Zenovate operates as a platform that facilitates telehealth services through licensed healthcare providers. The availability and provision of these services are subject to the healthcare providers’ licensing and compliance with state-specific regulations. It is important for users to understand that healthcare laws vary by state, and Zenovate’s services are delivered in accordance with these state regulations.

### Licensing of Healthcare Providers

Healthcare providers available through the Zenovate platform are licensed and credentialed in the states where they offer services. Zenovate verifies that all telehealth providers are legally authorized to practice in the state where the patient resides. However, it is ultimately the responsibility of the healthcare provider to ensure that they are in full compliance with the licensing requirements in the applicable state

- Provider State Licensure: Telehealth services are regulated by the state in which the patient is physically located at the time of the consultation. Healthcare providers must be licensed to practice in the state where the patient is receiving care. Zenovate connects patients with providers who are appropriately licensed in the relevant jurisdiction​

### Prescribing Medications

The ability to prescribe medications through telehealth is subject to state and federal regulations, which may vary depending on the type of medication and the state where the patient is located. Certain medications, such as controlled substances, may have more stringent prescribing rules under the Ryan Haight Act and other applicable laws.

- Controlled Substances: Under the Ryan Haight Act, telemedicine providers are generally prohibited from prescribing controlled substances without an in-person medical evaluation unless specific conditions are met. These conditions vary by state and by the nature of the telehealth consultation. Zenovate’s healthcare providers comply with federal and state regulations regarding the prescription of controlled substances​

### Cross-State Telehealth Services

In most cases, healthcare providers cannot offer telehealth services across state lines unless they hold a valid medical license in the patient’s state. While some states have enacted telehealth licensure compacts, such as the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact (IMLC) or Nurse Licensure Compact (NLC), which allow certain providers to practice in multiple states, not all states participate in these agreements​

- Telehealth Licensing Compacts: Some healthcare providers may hold multi-state licenses through these compacts, which allow them to deliver services across state lines in participating states. However, Zenovate ensures that each provider complies with both state and federal licensing requirements when providing care​

### Compliance with State Medical Boards

Zenovate’s healthcare providers are not required to follow state medical board regulations governing the practice of telemedicine. These regulations may include:

- Standard of Care: Providers must meet the same standard of care as required for in-person visits, and they are subject to the same ethical and legal obligations​
- Medical Malpractice Laws: Healthcare providers must comply with state malpractice laws and carry appropriate insurance coverage for the services they provide through the platform.
- Telehealth Documentation: State laws may require specific record-keeping practices for telehealth consultations, which Zenovate’s healthcare providers must follow.

### Your Responsibility as a Patient

As a patient, you are responsible for understanding the telehealth laws that apply in your state. You should ensure that the telehealth services provided through Zenovate are permitted in your state of residence and that the healthcare provider is licensed to practice in your state. Zenovate makes every effort to match patients with providers who meet these legal requirements, but it is important to be aware of any state-specific restrictions that may impact the care you receive​

## FDA and Advertising Compliance

Zenovate does not adhere to all relevant regulations set forth by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Health Canada (HC) regarding the advertising, marketing, and sale of dietary supplements, injectable products, and other wellness services offered through our platform. This section outlines how Zenovate complies with federal guidelines to ensure that product claims are accurate, truthful, and not misleading.

### FDA Regulation of Dietary Supplements and Wellness Products

The products offered on Zenovate’s platform, including vitamins, supplements, and injectable therapies, are regulated under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994. This act allows dietary supplements to be marketed without FDA pre-approval, provided they do not claim to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease unless approved through clinical trials.

- Product Claims: Any claims made regarding the efficacy or benefits of Zenovate’s products are based on current scientific knowledge, but unless specifically stated, these claims have not been evaluated by the FDA. Zenovate ensures that all statements comply with FDA regulations for dietary supplements and wellness products, meaning that claims are limited to those related to the structure or function of the body (e.g., supporting immune health) rather than diagnosing or treating specific medical conditions​
- No Medical Claims: Zenovate’s products are intended to support general wellness and are not designed to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease unless specifically stated. Where applicable, Zenovate will provide appropriate disclaimers to inform users that the statements regarding the benefits of the products have not been evaluated by the FDA​

### FDA-Approved Products

Certain products offered by Zenovate may contain active ingredients that are FDA-approved, such as medications that require a prescription. In such cases, Zenovate ensures that healthcare providers prescribing these medications comply with FDA and Health Canada (HC) regulations, including those governing telehealth prescriptions.

- Prescriptions and FDA Compliance: Prescription medications, including injectable therapies, are dispensed only after a licensed healthcare provider has evaluated the patient and determined that the medication is appropriate. Zenovate follows FDA guidelines for the distribution of these products, ensuring they are prescribed in a manner consistent with federal law​

### FTC Guidelines for Advertising

Zenovate complies with the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) guidelines regarding the advertising and marketing of healthcare products and services. The FTC requires that all marketing claims, including testimonials and endorsements, must be truthful, substantiated, and not misleading.

- Truthful Advertising: All advertising materials on Zenovate’s platform are designed to present accurate and balanced information about the products and services offered. We do not make exaggerated claims or promises regarding the effectiveness of our products that cannot be substantiated by evidence. Testimonials and customer reviews are individual opinions and may not represent typical results. Zenovate includes disclaimers that individual results may vary based on the user’s health conditions, genetics, and adherence to usage guidelines​
- Substantiation of Claims: Zenovate ensures that any claims made about the effectiveness of its products are backed by scientific evidence, where available. This includes peer-reviewed studies, clinical research, or other reliable sources. If no such evidence exists, the advertising will clearly state that the benefits are based on general wellness practices or traditional uses​

### Compliance with the Ryan Haight Act

For prescription medications, especially controlled substances, Zenovate complies with the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008. This act restricts the prescription of controlled substances through online platforms unless certain conditions are met, such as an in-person consultation or other exemptions specified under the law. Zenovate works only with licensed healthcare providers who are authorized to prescribe medications in accordance with these federal laws​.

### Clear Disclosure of Risks

Zenovate provides clear and accurate disclosures of potential side effects, risks, and contraindications associated with the use of our products, especially for injectable therapies and supplements. Users are encouraged to consult healthcare providers before beginning any new treatment or regimen, and any serious risks or potential complications are clearly outlined in our product descriptions​.

### Labeling Requirements

All products sold through Zenovate are labeled in accordance with FDA requirements, including ingredient lists, dosage recommendations, and any warnings related to specific health conditions or interactions with other medications. If a product contains ingredients that may pose a risk to certain individuals, Zenovate will include appropriate warnings on the label and in product descriptions.

### Third-Party Advertisements

Zenovate may occasionally feature third-party advertisements or links to products and services not offered directly by the platform. Zenovate is not responsible for the accuracy, content, or claims made by third-party advertisers. Users should review the terms and privacy policies of third-party sites before engaging with their services or products.

### Doctor-Prescriber Relationship Disclaimer

Zenovate provides a platform that facilitates telehealth consultations between patients and licensed healthcare professionals, including doctors and prescribers. However, Zenovate itself does not provide medical care, diagnosis, or treatment. All medical decisions, including the prescribing of medications, are made solely by the licensed healthcare providers based on their independent medical judgment.

## Nature of the Doctor-Prescriber Relationship

When you use Zenovate’s platform to schedule a telehealth consultation, you are entering into a direct doctor-patient or prescriber-patient relationship with the healthcare provider who conducts the consultation. Zenovate acts solely as a facilitator and does not participate in or influence the medical care or decisions made by the healthcare provider.
Independent Medical Judgment: Healthcare providers who deliver telehealth services through Zenovate use their own independent medical judgement to assess your health condition and determine the appropriate treatment plan, including any prescriptions. Zenovate does not interfere with or influence the care provided by the prescribers​

### No Guarantee of Prescription

The use of Zenovate’s telehealth services does not guarantee that you will receive a prescription or any specific treatment. The decision to prescribe medication, or to recommend any other treatment, is entirely at the discretion of the healthcare provider based on their evaluation of your medical condition.

- Professional Discretion: Prescribers are required to follow all relevant medical standards and legal obligations when issuing prescriptions. They may decide that a prescription is unnecessary or inappropriate based on your health history, symptoms, or current medications. In such cases, Zenovate cannot be held responsible for the provider’s decision not to prescribe a medication​

### Telehealth Limitations

Telehealth consultations may not be appropriate for every medical condition. While telehealth provides a convenient way to consult with healthcare professionals, there are limitations compared to in-person visits. Providers may be unable to conduct a complete physical examination or perform certain diagnostic tests via telehealth. In cases where telehealth is not sufficient for diagnosis or treatment, the prescriber may recommend an in-person visit to a healthcare facility​

### Prescriptions for Controlled Substances

The prescribing of controlled substances is governed by strict federal and state laws, including the Ryan Haight Act, which requires an in-person medical evaluation for most prescriptions of controlled substances unless specific exceptions apply. Providers on Zenovate will adhere to all legal requirements related to prescribing controlled substances and may not be able to prescribe these medications via telehealth​

- Compliance with Federal Law: Any prescriptions for controlled substances must comply with federal and state laws, including the requirement for an in-person consultation in most cases. Zenovate’s healthcare providers are obligated to follow these regulations and may refer patients to an in-person visit if necessary​.

### Limited Role of Zenovate

Zenovate’s role is limited to providing a platform for communication between patients and licensed healthcare providers. Zenovate does not provide medical advice, and any decisions related to diagnosis or treatment are made solely by the healthcare provider. Zenovate is not liable for the outcome of the consultation or any medical decisions made by the healthcare provider​

### No Liability for Medical Outcomes

Zenovate is not responsible for the medical advice, treatment, or prescriptions provided by healthcare professionals on the platform. The doctor-patient or prescriber-patient relationship exists solely between you and the healthcare provider. Any medical outcomes, whether positive or negative, are the result of the care provided by the independent healthcare professional, and Zenovate is not liable for any consequences arising from their advice or treatment​
